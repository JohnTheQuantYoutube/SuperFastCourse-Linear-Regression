![LinReg_Inference.ipynb](https://github.com/JohnTheQuantYoutube/SuperFastCourse-Linear-Regression/blob/main/LinReg_Inference.ipynb)

This notebook contains all of the code for the OLS example, drawing inference on what affects math scores in Portugese high school students.

![prepped_data.csv](https://github.com/JohnTheQuantYoutube/SuperFastCourse-Linear-Regression/blob/main/prepped_data.csv)

This file contains the data that was cleaned, transformed, and encoded in the LinReg_Inference notebook.

![Regulatized_LinReg.ipynb](https://github.com/JohnTheQuantYoutube/SuperFastCourse-Linear-Regression/blob/main/Regularized_LinReg.ipynb)

This notebook contains the code for the regularized linear regression example(s); SGDRegressor, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and ElasticNet.
Predictive performance is compared between model types.

![LinearFactorModel.ipynb](https://github.com/JohnTheQuantYoutube/SuperFastCourse-Linear-Regression/blob/main/LinearFactorModel.ipynb)

This notebook contains all of the code for creating the Fama-French 5-Factor Model by Fama-Macbeth regression, in the Finance Applications portion at the end of the course.
